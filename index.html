			<h1>The Phantom Menace</h1>
			<p>Partially, but it also obeys your commands. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.</p>
			<h2>Jedi Academy</h2>
			<p>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.</li>
				<li>What?!</li>
				<li>What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>The Empire Strikes Back</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<h4>Revenge of the Sith</h4>
			<p>A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?</p>
			<ol>
				<li>What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like… suicide.</li>
				<li>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly…</li>
				<li>What!?</li>
				<li>A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. You don't believe in the Force, do you? The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</p>
